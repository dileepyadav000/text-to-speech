## Features

- **Text Conversion:** Converts any written text into natural-sounding speech.
- **Multiple Voices:** Supports multiple voice options (e.g., male, female).
- **Language Support:** Works with multiple languages.
- **Customizable Speed and Pitch:** Allows adjustments to the speed and pitch of the speech.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple API for integration into other projects.
